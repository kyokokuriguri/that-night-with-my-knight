<center><h3><p>“Hey lily, its time to get up.” he said softly as he lightly shook me awake. I just rolled over and groaned as if I was
telling him no, let me sleep. “I know you look so cute sleeping, but it almost twelve in the afternoon” I could see the bit of sunlight
seepin in from the crack in the curtions. it was bright enight to blind a person just getting up.</p></h3></center>
<h3><p><center>“Ok fine i'll get up.” I said with a raspy voice.i then rolled over to look at the ceiling. </p></h3></body></center>
<center><h3><p>As I opened my eyes I saw him on top of me. In that moment i thoghjt he was going to fuck me?
  “おはようダーリン” he said then kissed me. He stuck his tongue so far down my throat, I was getting deep throated.
   It felt so good.as he did that i garabes his face and coerced it in my hands.</p></center></h3>

   <h3><center><p>Suddenly I felt something in between my thighs. It was his knee.</p></center></h3>
   <h3><p><center>With his tongue still deep in my mouth I let out a small but subttle moan. </center></p></h3>
   <h3><p><center>He then pulled his face away and removed his leg from in between my thighs.
   “You definitely are my good little kitten. Are you ready to get up now kitten?”</center></p></h3>
   <h3><p><center>“Meow, kitten doesn't want to get out of bed. Kitten just wants to be a cat today, meow” I said in a cute voice.</center></p></h3>
   <h3><p><center>“Well i don't mind if you lay there just don't fall back asleep, ok?” he said as he got off the bed and left the room.
   He was wearing only his boxers and an old fnaf t-shirt.<i>“Ah, I remember when that game came out. Security breach,
   it was a dark game, yet it had a neon color platelet. It came out like ten years ago or more.”</i> I thought to myself
   as I grabbed my phone. “Oh a notification from ash. I wonder how she is doing.”</center></p></h3>
   <h6><p>page 2 in my book</p></h6><hr>
   <h3><p><center>After scrolling tick tock for what felt like five minutes, I decided to get out of bed.
   I slipped on my oversized lifeguard hoodie and left the room.</center></p></h3>
   <h3><p><center>“Hey lily good to see you out of bed.” he said sitting on the couch playing super smash bros on his switch.
   “Oh and I made your favorite. Cheesy scrambled eggs. I put it in the microwave to keep warm.”</center></p></h3>
   <h6><p>page 3 in my book</p></h6><hr>
   <h3><p><center>“How long ago did you make them?” i groggily said</center></p></h3>
   <h3><p><center>“Oh about like… I think ten fifteen minutes ago?” he said unsure, still playing his switch</center></p></h3>
   <h3><p><center>I then grabbed a fork and my eggs and ate them on the couch next to him. </center></p></h3>
   <h3><p><cebnter>After I was done eating I just set my plate on the coffee table in front of us, laid my head 
   on his shoulder and fell back asleep.</cebnter></p></h3>
   <h3><p><center> “Aww you're asleep again i see huh? We did stay up till the crack of dawn.”
   he said as he moved my head to be on his thigh. He sounded as if he was talking to a baby. 
   He put a blanket over me and just let me sleep there.</center></h3></p>
   <h6><p>page 4 in my book</p></h6><hr>
   <h3><p><center>“You're so cute when you a-” I fell asleep as he was speaking so I didn't quite catch what he said all the way.
   But if i  had to guess he said i'm cute when im sleeping</center></h3></p>
   <h3><p><center>"you're so cute when you a-" I fell asleep as he was speeking so I didn't quite catch what he was saying.
  but if I had to assume it was im cute when im sleping.</center></p></h3>
  <h3><p><center>"Ok Lily you have to get up now its almost three in the after noon." he said witha a serius tone</center></p></h3>
  <h3><p><center>"Okay" I said as i slowly sat up. the blaket fell off me as I sat up</center></p></h3>
  <h3><p><center>"I'll be back in a minute." he said softly.</center></p> 
    <h3><p><center>"K" I said like a baby wile rubbing my eye.</center></p></h3>
